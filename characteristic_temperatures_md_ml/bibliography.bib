abstract = {Based on the consideration of both the resistance of amorphous phase against crystallization and the stability of under-cooled liquid against competing crystalline phase formation, a criterion $\omega$, defined as Tg/Tx- 2Tg/(Tg+ Tl) (Tg, Txand Tldenote the glass transition temperature, the onset crystallization temperature and the liquidus temperature, respectively), has been proposed for evaluating the glass-forming ability (GFA) of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). A survey of the readily available experimental data associated with the thermal analysis of various glass-forming alloys shows that the new criterion $\omega$ exhibits the best correlation with the maximum section thickness (Dmax) as well as the critical cooling rate (Rc) for glass formation among other criteria proposed in recent years, such as Trg(=Tg/Tl), $\Delta$Tx(=Tx- Tg), $\gamma$(=Tx/(Tg+ Tl)), $\gamma$m(=(2Tx- Tg)/Tl), $\Delta$Trg(=(Tx- Tg)/(Tl- Tg)), $\delta$(=Tx/(Tl- Tg), $\phi$(=Trg($\Delta$Tx/Tg)0.143, $\alpha$(=Tx/Tl), $\beta$(=(Tx/Tg+ Tg/Tl) and $\beta$(=Tx× Tg/(Tl- Tx)2).

abstract = {The glass transition temperature, Tg, is important for predicting glass formation and stability and for designing processing steps for tailoring the glass to specific applications. It is conventionally determined from measurements of the shear viscosity or specific heat. This requires that the glass first be made, significantly limiting the use of this parameter for the prediction of glass formation. Further, viscosity or specific heat measurements can only be made for glasses that have a high stability against crystallization at Tg. It is demonstrated here that it is possible to accurately predict Tg from measurements of the shear viscosity and thermal expansion coefficient of the high temperature equilibrium liquid. In addition to the practical usefulness of this, the connection between the glass transition and the properties of the equilibrium liquid may shed light into the processes that determine glass formation in metallic alloys and of the nature of the glass transition.},

@article{Jaiswal2016,
abstract = {We report the observation of a distinct correlation between the kinetic fragility index m and the reduced Arrhenius crossover temperature $\theta$ A ¼ T A =T g in various glass-forming liquids, identifying three distin-guishable groups. In particular, for 11 glass-forming metallic liquids, we universally observe a crossover in the mean diffusion coefficient from high-temperature Arrhenius to low-temperature super-Arrhenius behavior at approximately $\theta$ A ≈ 2 which is in the stable liquid phases. In contrast, for fragile molecular liquids, this crossover occurs at much lower $\theta$ A ≈ 1.4 and usually in their supercooled states. The $\theta$ A values for strong network liquids spans a wide range higher than 2. Intriguingly, the high-temperature activation barrier E ∞ is universally found to be ∼11k B T g and uncorrelated with the fragility or the reduced crossover temperature $\theta$ A for metallic and molecular liquids. These observations provide a way to estimate the low-temperature glassy characteristics (T g and m) from the high-temperature liquid quantities (E ∞ and $\theta$ A). The fragility of a glass-forming liquid is a measure of how quickly its dynamics slows down upon cooling. It is usually quantified by the kinetic fragility index m, which is defined as the slope of the Angell plot of transport coefficients in logarithmic scale versus T g =T evaluated at the glass transition temperature T g [1]: m ¼ ∂ log $\eta$ðTÞ ∂ðT g =TÞ T¼T g : ð1Þ A liquid that undergoes little change in the slope as a function of temperature is called a kinetically "strong" system. Examples include many of the network liquids such as silica, soda lime glasses, etc. The other end of the spectrum, defined as "fragile," corresponds to systems that show significant increases in slope with cooling. Examples include many of the van der Waals molecular liquids, polymers, ionic liquids, etc. Notably, many of the glass-forming metallic liquids that are mediated by complex many-body metallic interactions span the intermediate fragility range [2,3]. This fact has inspired us to systematically compare the nature of slow dynamics of these metallic liquids with other glass formers, namely, molecular liquids and network liquids. To date, an agreed quantitative understanding of fragility is still lacking [4,5]. The glass transition temperature T g and the fragility index m are key parameters quantifying the low-temperature behavior of liquids. The Arrhenius crossover phenomenon occurring well above T g quantifies the high-temperature activated behavior of liquids [6-11] and has attracted much attention recently, especially in metallic liquids [12-14]. For instance, in many molecular liquids the Arrhenius crossover or glassy-dynamics-onset temperature T A marks the deviation of the transport coefficients or the relaxation time from the high-temperature Arrhenius dependence as well as the deviation of the intermediate scattering function from a simple exponential relaxation. This crossover is believed to indicate increasingly dynamically heterogeneous and cooperative motion when temperature is lowered below T A [15,16]. Above T A , particles move relatively independently without the need for a collective reorganization of their respective local environment due to the large mobility and phonon localization [12]. However, when the temperature is lowered, collective reorganization of particles (local topological excitations [12], hopping [17], etc.) over increasing length scales is needed to facilitate large amplitude irreversible motions in cold dense media. Such cooperative motion allows the system to overcome large free energy barriers and relax, resulting in highly activated dynamics [10,18-23]. Note that it is T A , and not T g , that marks the onset of such cooperativity and dynamic heterogeneity. Similarly, in strong liquids, cooperativity and spatially heterogeneous dynamics have also been observed with emerging slow dynamics. However, the apparent Arrhenius behavior of transport properties remains largely unchanged down to low temperatures since large scale cooperative motions are less relevant due to the PRL 117, 205701 (2016) P H Y S I C A L},

Many studies have shown that the reduced glass transition temperature, Tg/Tl (where Tg and Tl are the glass transition and liquidus temperature), and the liquid fragility, m, play an important role in metallic glass formation. The combination of these parameters can lead to a predictive formula for the maximum casting thickness for the glass. However, Tg and m can only be determined after the glass is made. Here, a new prediction formula is given that uses only properties of the high temperature liquid. The method works well in most, but not all, cases. It fails when the atomic structures of the liquid and primary crystallizing phases are similar; this lowers the crystal nucleation barrier and makes glass formation more difficult. We first demonstrate the importance of including the liquid and crystal structures in a truly predictive method for glass formation.},

The interrelationship between the new criterion ϖ and Dmax exhibits better ability for evaluating GFA of the alloys than nine criteria reported in literature, and the values of Dmax of Fe-BMGs could be calculated by this ϖ parameter in an appreciable range.

This complex dynamics is believed to be responsible for different phenomena including non-exponential relaxation and the breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation.

abstract = {Three parallel algorithms for classical molecular dynamics are presented. The first assigns each processor a fixed subset of atoms; the second assigns each a fixed subset of inter-atomic forces to compute; the third assigns each a fixed spatial region. The algorithms are suitable for molecular dynamics models which can be difficult to parallelize efficiently - those with short-range forces where the neighbors of each atom change rapidly. They can be implemented on any distributed-memory parallel machine which allows for message-passing of data between independently executing processors. The algorithms are tested on a standard Lennard-Jones benchmark problem for system sizes ranging from 500 to 100,000,000 atoms on several parallel supercomputers - the nCUBE 2, Intel iPSC/860 and Paragon, and Cray T3D. Comparing the results to the fastest reported vectorized Cray Y-MP and C90 algorithm shows that the current generation of parallel machines is competitive with conventional vector supercomputers even for small problems. For large problems, the spatial algorithm achieves parallel efficiencies of 90{\%} and a 1840-node Intel Paragon performs up to 165 faster than a single Cray C9O processor. Trade-offs between the three algorithms and guidelines for adapting them to more complex molecular dynamics simulations are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

Further development of novel biomaterials, that are much safer and of much higher quality, in terms of both biomedical and mechanical properties, are therefore of great interest for both the research scientists and clinical surgeons. Compared with the conventional crystalline metallic counterparts, bulk metallic glasses have unique amorphous structures, and thus exhibit higher strength, lower Young's modulus, improved wear resistance, good fatigue endurance, and excellent corrosion resistance. For this purpose, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) have recently attracted much attention for biomedical applications. This review discusses and summarizes the recent developments and advances of bulk metallic glasses, including Ti-based, Zr-based, Fe-based, Mg-based, Zn-based, Ca-based and Sr-based alloying systems for biomedical applications. Future research directions will move towards overcoming the brittleness, increasing the glass forming ability (GFA) thus obtaining corresponding bulk metallic glasses with larger sizes, removing/reducing toxic elements, and surface modifications. Statement of Significance Bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), also known as amorphous alloys or liquid metals, are relative newcomers in the field of biomaterials.

Superior soft magnetic properties additionally require low magnetostriction, which is true of amorphous Co-based alloys and, more recently, nanocrystalline Fe-based alloys, but at a significantly higher saturation induction and with better thermal stability.

@article{Iwashita2013,
abstract = {The elementary excitations of vibration in solids are phonons. But in liquids phonons are extremely short lived and marginalized. In this Letter through classical and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid state of various metallic systems we show that different excitations, the local configurational excitations in the atomic connectivity network, are the elementary excitations in high temperature metallic liquids. We also demonstrate that the competition between the configurational excitations and phonons determines the so-called crossover phenomenon in liquids. These discoveries open the way to the explanation of various complex phenomena in liquids, such as fragility and the rapid increase in viscosity toward the glass transition, in terms of these excitations. The physics of phonon in crystalline solids is well understood [1]. For instance its frequency can be calculated by diagonalizing the dynamical (Hessian) matrix, the matrix of which elements are the second derivative of the total energy with respect to the atomic displacements [1]. In liquids, however, the dynamical matrix itself is time dependent because the atomic structure is changing with time. If the dynamical matrix varies as fast as, or faster than phonons [2] the validity of the concept of phonon becomes questionable. Yet, it is known that at high temperatures the specific heat of a liquid approximately satisfies the Dulong-Petit law of C V ¼ 3k B [3], suggesting the presence of some well-defined excitations. But the nature of such excitations in liquids is unknown. In general, we know very little about the atomic dynamics in liquids. Theoretically, the flow of a liquid is commonly described by continuum hydrodynamic theories [4,5]. Less attention has been paid to the atomic level dynamics because it has been believed that the liquids were so random that details of the atomic motion were irrelevant to the physics of liquid flow. For instance, the energy landscape theory describes atoms in a liquid at high temperatures as diffusing almost freely well above the peaks and valleys of the energy landscape, seeing only shallow minima [6]. Actually, at high temperatures above the so-called crossover temperature viscosity shows the Arrhenius behavior of thermal activation [7,8]. However, the nature of such activation processes and the origin of the crossover behavior remain unclear. In this Letter we show that elementary excitations different from phonons exist in liquids, and they are the origin of viscosity, and that the competition between the high-temperature elementary excitations and phonons results in the crossover phenomenon in liquids. This is done through classical as well as ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on various metallic liquids in either NVT or NPT ensembles. The periodic boundary condition on a cubic box was imposed for all systems. For liquid iron the model consisted of 16 384 atoms interacting via the modified Johnson potential [9]. The binary Kob-Andersen (KA) model [10] of 80=20 mixture (80{\%} particle A and 20{\%} particle B) consisted of 10 976 Lennard-Jones (LJ) particles at a reduced density of 1.2. All results for the KA model are expressed in argon units. The simulations were performed in a temperature range from 60 to 300 K, under the NVT ensemble. For Cu 56 Zr 44 and Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 , we employed the embedded atom method (EAM) potentials [11,12] and simulated the systems with 16 000 atoms for Cu 56 Zr 44 under NVT ensemble, and with 32 000 atoms for Zr 50 Cu 40 Al 10 under NPT ensemble with pressure equal to zero. The simulations were carried out using the LAMMPS software. Ab initio MD simulations of Cu 56 Zr 44 in the NVT ensemble were performed using dynamics based on forces from the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method [13] (Gamma point only) as implemented in the VASP 4.6 code [14]. The simulation cell contained 200 atoms with periodic boundary conditions. The sample was equilibrated using a Nos{\'{e}}-Hoover thermostat [15,16] at T ¼ 4000, 4500, and 5000 K for 3 ps followed by 1.1 ps of data collection during which the positions and stress matrix were recorded every time step (fs). Further details of the methods are given in the Supplemental Material [17]. The viscosity is a key parameter describing the dynamics of liquids. It is given by the Green-Kubo formula [18], ¼ V k B T Z 1 0 h xy ð0Þ xy ðtÞidt; (1) where xy is the x-y component of the stress tensor, T is the temperature and V is the volume of the liquid.

abstract = {The range of magnitude of the liquid viscosity, $\eta$, as a function of temperature is one of the most impressive of any physical property, changing by approximately 17 orders of magnitude from its extrapolated value at infinite temperature ($\eta$o) to that at the glass transition temperature, Tg. We present experimental measurements of containerlessly processed metallic liquids that suggest that log($\eta$/$\eta$o) as a function of TA/T is a potentially universal scaled curve. In stark contrast to previous approaches, the scaling requires only two fitting parameters, which are on average predictable. The temperature TA corresponds to the onset of cooperative motion and is strongly correlated with Tg, suggesting that the processes underlying the glass transition first appear in the high temperature liquid.},

In this work, we propose a new method to include diffraction data in the potential development procedure, which also includes fitting to first-principles and liquid density and enthalpy of mixing data. To refine the new potential, we used first-principles and liquid enthalpy of mixing data published earlier combined with the densities of liquid Cu64.5Zr35.5 measured over a range of temperatures.

abstract = {With more than a hundred elements in the periodic table, a large number of potential new materials exist to address the technological and societal challenges we face today; however, without some guidance, searching through this vast combinatorial space is frustratingly slow and expensive, especially for materials strongly influenced by processing. We train a machine learning (ML) model on previously reported observations, parameters from physiochemical theories, and make it synthesis method–dependent to guide high-throughput (HiTp) experiments to find a new system of metallic glasses in the Co-V-Zr ternary. Experimental observations are in good agreement with the predictions of the model, but there are quantitative discrepancies in the precise compositions predicted. We use these discrepancies to retrain the ML model. The refined model has significantly improved accuracy not only for the Co-V-Zr system but also across all other available validation data. We then use the refined model to guide the discovery of metallic glasses in two additional previously unreported ternaries. Although our approach of iterative use of ML and HiTp experiments has guided us to rapid discovery of three new glass-forming systems, it has also provided us with a quantitatively accurate, synthesis method–sensitive predictor for metallic glasses that improves performance with use and thus promises to greatly accelerate discovery of many new metallic glasses. We believe that this discovery paradigm is applicable to a wider range of materials and should prove equally powerful for other materials and properties that are synthesis path–dependent and that current physiochemical theories find challenging to predict.},

Three approacheds were made for ML: Added the synthesys= method as an attribute, separately train ML on synthesis methods, and feed the melt-spun data into a new model on sputtering.

One limitation to the wide-scale use of these materials is the lack of predictable tools for understanding the relationships between alloy composition and ideal properties. To address this issue, we developed a framework for designing metallic glasses using machine learning (ML) models that predict three key properties of candidate BMG compositions: ability to exist in an amorphous state, critical casting diameter (Dmax), and supercooled liquid range ($\Delta$Tx). Our models take only the composition of the alloy as input, and were created from a database of more than 8000 metallic glass experiments assembled from several dozen papers and handbooks. We employed these ML models to optimize the properties of existing commercial alloys and found, experimentally, several of our ML-predicted compositions can form glasses and exceed existing alloys in one of our two design variables, $\Delta$Tx.},

abstract = {Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier's performance across a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance, owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.},

Here we highlight the wide variety of local chemical ordering (LCO) that sets these concentrated SSs apart from traditional solvent-solute ones. Using atomistic simulations, we reveal that the LCO of the multi-principal-element NiCoCr SS changes with alloy processing conditions, producing a wide range of generalized planar fault energies. We show that the LCO heightens the ruggedness of the energy landscape and raises activation barriers governing dislocation activities. This influences the selection of dislocation pathways in slip, faulting, and twinning, and increases the lattice friction to dislocation motion via a nanoscale segment detrapping mechanism. In contrast, severe plastic deformation reduces the LCO towards random SS.},

abstract = {Atomistic simulations using classical interatomic potentials are powerful investigative tools linking atomic structures to dynamic properties and behaviors. It is well known that different interatomic potentials produce different results, thus making it necessary to characterize potentials based on how they predict basic properties. Doing so makes it possible to compare existing interatomic models in order to select those best suited for specific use cases, and to identify any limitations of the models that may lead to unrealistic responses. While the methods for obtaining many of these properties are often thought of as simple calculations, there are many underlying aspects that can lead to variability in the reported property values. For instance, multiple methods may exist for computing the same property and values may be sensitive to certain simulation parameters. Here, we introduce a new high-throughput computational framework that encodes various simulation methodologies as Python calculation scripts. Three distinct methods for evaluating the lattice and elastic constants of bulk crystal structures are implemented and used to evaluate the properties across 120 interatomic potentials, 18 crystal prototypes, and all possible combinations of unique lattice site and elemental model pairings. Analysis of the results reveals which potentials and crystal prototypes are sensitive to the calculation methods and parameters, and it assists with the verification of potentials, methods, and molecular dynamics software. The results, calculation scripts, and computational infrastructure are self-contained and openly available to support researchers in performing meaningful simulations.},

abstract = {Alloys based on Cu–Zr–Al are known for their relative easiness in producing glassy structures. However, several important aspects related to the microstructure and the Glass Forming Ability (GFA) are still not well understood. Here, we present results referring to Molecular Dynamics simulations (MD) of rapidly quenched glassy Cu–Zr–Al of two compositions. GFAs were investigated, both experimentally and by MD simulations, using x-ray diffraction, High-Resolution Transmission Electron microscopy and Differential Scanning Calorimetry, while the structural evolution upon cooling was investigated by simulations using radial distribution functions, Voronoi tessellation analysis, and volume–temperature curves. Moreover, the viscosity evolution as well as the glass transition temperature and the fragility parameters were also estimated. Good agreement was found between the MD simulation results and the experimental data. It came out that the Zr–rich composition resulted in a ‘stronger' metallic liquid than the Cu–rich composition. In addition, we found that the evolution of distorted into well shaped icosahedral clusters upon solidification, is a determining factor for the stability of the Zr–rich metallic glass. Moreover, we propose a new criterion based on a weighted average of the atomic radius ratio that has been found promising in adequately predicting glass forming abilities.},

abstract = {Surface-grating decay has been measured for three organic glasses with extensive hydrogen bonding: sorbitol, maltitol, and maltose. For 1000 nm wavelength gratings, the decay occurs by viscous flow in the entire range of temperature studied, covering the viscosity range 105-1011 Pa s, whereas under the same conditions, the decay mechanism transitions from viscous flow to surface diffusion for organic glasses of similar molecular sizes but with no or limited hydrogen bonding. These results indicate that extensive hydrogen bonding slows down surface diffusion in organic glasses. This effect arises because molecules can preserve hydrogen bonding even near the surface so that the loss of nearest neighbors does not translate into a proportional decrease of the kinetic barrier for diffusion. This explanation is consistent with a strong correlation between liquid fragility and the surface enhancement of diffusion, both reporting resistance of a liquid to dynamic excitation. Slow surface diffusion is expected to hinder any processes that rely on surface transport, for example, surface crystal growth and formation of stable glasses by vapor deposition.},

abstract = {Atomic packing in metallic glasses is not completely random but displays various degrees of structural ordering. While it is believed that local structures profoundly affect the properties of glasses, a fundamental understanding of the structure-property relationship has been lacking. In this article, we provide a microscopic picture to uncover the intricate interplay between structural defects and dynamic properties of metallic glasses, from the perspective of computational modeling. Computational methodologies for such realistic modeling are introduced. Exploiting the concept of quasi-equivalent cluster packing, we quantify the structural ordering of a prototype metallic glass during its formation process, with a new focus on geometric measures of subatomic "voids." Atomic sites connected with the voids are found to be crucial in terms of understanding the dynamic, including vibrational and atomic transport, properties. Normal mode analysis is performed to reveal the structural origin of the anomalous boson peak (BP) in the vibration spectrum of the glass, and its correlation with atomic packing cavities. Through transition-state search on the energy landscape of the system, such structural disorder is found to be a facilitating factor for atomic diffusion, with diffusion energy barriers and diffusion pathways significantly varying with the degree of structural relaxation/ordering. The implications of structural defects for the mechanical properties of metallic glasses are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Author(s).},

The developed method is applied to the calculation of melting points of Al, Si, Ge, Sn and MgO. The applications indicate that more than 99 \% of the first principles calculations are bypassed during the force field generation. This allows the machine to quickly construct first principles datasets over wide phase spaces. Furthermore, with the help of the generated machine learning force fields, simulations are accelerated by a factor of thousand compared with first principles calculations.

Various combinations of characteristic temperatures, such as the glass transition temperature, liquidus temperature, and crystallization temperature, have been proposed as predictions of the glass forming ability of metal alloys. We have used statistical approaches from machine learning to systematically explore a wide range of possible characteristic temperature functions for predicting glass forming ability in the form of critical casting diameter, Dmax. Both linear and non-linear models were used to learn on the largest database of Dmax values to date consisting of 747 compositions. We find that no combination of temperatures for features offers a better prediction of Dmax in a machine learning model than the temperatures themselves, and that regression models suffer from poor performance on standard machine learning metrics like root mean square error (minimum value of 3.3Â±0.1Â mm for data with a standard deviation of 4.8Â mm). Examination of the errors vs. database size suggest that a larger database may improve results, although a database significantly larger than that used here would likely be required. Shifting a focus from regression to categorization models learning from characteristic temperatures can be used to weakly distinguish glasses likely to be above vs. below our databaseâ€™s median Dmax value of 4.0 mm, with a mean F1 score of 0.77Â±0.02 for this categorization. The overall weak results on predicting Dmax suggests that critical cooling rate might be a better target for machine learning model prediction.}

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

By defining the probability measure on a set of the studied combinatorial objects various numerical characteristics of these objects can be considered as random variables and studied using the methods of probability theory. The advantage of this approach is the well-developed probabilistic analytic techniques that allow us in many cases to obtain results, the proof of which by other methods appears too complicated, if indeed it is at all possible. The application of probabilistic methods is connected with extensive use of the terminology of probability theory. The reader will easily understand however that one speaks in fact about solving enumerative problems of discrete analysis. One of the primary research lines is the study of the limit properties of combinatorial objects manifested at the unlimited increase of the number of elements comprising such objects. It is often possible to represent the distributions of the characteristics of combinatorial objects as conditional distributions of the sums of independent random variables so that they can be studied using asymptotic methods in probability theory, namely limit theorems for sums of independent random variables.},

abstract = {Many models have been created and attempted to describe the temperature-dependent viscosity of glass-forming liquids, which is the foundational feature to lay out the mechanism of obtaining desired glass properties. Most viscosity models were generated along with several impact factors. The complex compositions of commercial glasses raise challenges to settle these parameters. Usually, this issue will lead to unsatisfactory predicted results when fitted to a real viscosity profile. In fact, the introduction of the reliable viscosity-temperature data to viscosity equations is an effective approach to obtain the accurate parameters. In this paper, the Eyring viscosity equation, which is widely adopted for molecular and polymer liquids, was applied in this case to calculate the viscosity of glass materials. On the basis of the linear variation of molar volume with temperature during glass cooling, a modified temperature-dependent Eyring viscosity equation was derived with a distinguished mathematical expression. By means of combining high-temperature viscosity data and the glass transition temperature (Tg), nonlinear regression analysis was employed to obtain the accurate parameters of the equation. In addition, we have demonstrated that the different regression methods exert a great effect on the final prediction results. The viscosity of a series of glasses across a wide temperature range was accurately predicted via the optimal regression method, which was further used to verify the reliability of the modified Eyring equation.},
