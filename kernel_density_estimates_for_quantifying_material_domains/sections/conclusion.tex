\section{Conclusion}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have shown that our $D$ score scales with chemical intuition for what should be ID or OD.
    \item We have shown that our $D$ scores do scale with residuals on average, and give us information for discerning higher and lower uncertainties via our precision recall curves.
    \item The $D$ score can also measure how dissimilar data can become before z-scores are no longer distributed in a standard normal way.
    \item Our $D$ score is powerful because it learns from the feature space alone could be added to many model types.
    \item Both the single and statistical numerical methods are easily implementable thorugh the MAST-ML package (or at least will be).
