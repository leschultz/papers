abstract = {Based on the classical theory of nucleation, a new criterion ϖ, defined as (Tx−Tg)⋅Tg⋅Tx/(Tl−Tx)3 (where Tg, Tx and Tl are the glass transition temperature, the onset crystallization temperature and the liquidus temperature) and correlated to the critical casting diameter (Dmax), which has been proposed to evaluate the glass-forming ability (GFA) of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). According to the linear fitting results of 667 reported BMGs, the relationship between Dmax and ϖ is expressed as Dmax=(1.08±0.26)+(10.22±0.45)ϖ. The interrelationship between the new criterion ϖ and Dmax exhibits better ability for evaluating GFA of the alloys than nine criteria reported in literature, and the values of Dmax of Fe-BMGs could be calculated by this ϖ parameter in an appreciable range. Therefore, the proposed ϖ parameter has certain significance for the development of new metallic glasses and the determination of their Dmax.},

@article{Long2009,
abstract = {Based on the consideration of both the resistance of amorphous phase against crystallization and the stability of under-cooled liquid against competing crystalline phase formation, a criterion $\omega$, defined as Tg/Tx - 2Tg/(Tg + Tl) (Tg, Tx and Tl denote the glass transition temperature, the onset crystallization temperature and the liquidus temperature, respectively), has been proposed for evaluating the glass-forming ability (GFA) of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs). A survey of the readily available experimental data associated with the thermal analysis of various glass-forming alloys shows that the new criterion $\omega$ exhibits the best correlation with the maximum section thickness (Dmax) as well as the critical cooling rate (Rc) for glass formation among other criteria proposed in recent years, such as Trg(=Tg/Tl), $\Delta$Tx(=Tx - Tg), $\gamma$(=Tx/(Tg + Tl)), $\gamma$m(=(2Tx - Tg)/Tl), $\Delta$Trg(=(Tx - Tg)/(Tl - Tg)), $\delta$(=Tx/(Tl - Tg), $\phi$(=Trg($\Delta$Tx/Tg)0.143, $\alpha$(=Tx/Tl), $\beta$(=(Tx/Tg + Tg/Tl) and $\beta$(=Tx × Tg/(Tl - Tx)2). Therefore, it can be anticipated that this new criterion will be used as a useful and efficient guideline for exploring new BMG formers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A new indicator of glass-forming ability (GFA) for bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) is proposed based on crystallization processes during cooling and reheating of the supercooled liquid. The interrelationship between this new parameter and the critical cooling rate or critical section thickness is elaborated and discussed in comparison with two other representatives, i.e. reduced glass transition temperature Trg ( = Tg/Tl, where Tg and Tl are the glass transition temperature and liquidus temperature, respectively) and supercooled liquid range $\Delta$Txg ( = Tx - Tg, where Tx is the onset crystallization temperature and Tg the glass transition temperature). Our results have shown that $\Delta$Txg alone cannot infer relative GFA for BMGs while the new parameter $\gamma$, defined as Tx/(Tg + Tl), has a much better interrelationship with GFA than Trg. An approximation of the critical cooling rate and critical section thickness for glass formation in bulk metallic glasses is also formulated and evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. on behalf of Acta Materialia Inc.},

The new model with optimized hyperparameters successfully boosts the prediction accuracy by over 12{\%}. The improvement is primarily attributed to the additional critical features (e.g. mixing entropy and total electronegativity) that has been identified. Although the improved model is still far away from being satisfactory (R2 = 0.64) due to the extremely unbalanced nature of the dataset, the new identified features will significantly facilitate the future model development with more and more emerging experimental data.},

abstract = {Generally substances are more stable in a crystalline than in a glassy state. Therefore, to form a glass, crystallization must be bypassed. Under certain conditions, the melts of many substances can be cooled to the glass state. Whether or not the melt of a given material forms a glass is determined principally by a set of factors which can be specified to some extent in the laboratory, namely, the cooling rate, - T, the liquid volume, v], and the seed density, ps and upon a set of materials constants: the reduced crystal–liquid interfacial tension, $\alpha$ the fraction, f, of acceptor sites in the crystal surface, and the reduced glass temperature, Trg.The glass-forming tendency will be greater the larger are - T and Trg and the smaller are v]. ps, and f. The number and variety of substances which have been prepared in a glassy or ‘amorphous solid' form have been greatly increased with techniques in which the material is condensed from solution on to a surface held well below its glass temperature. There are at least some glass formers in every category of material, according to bond type, i.e. covalent, ionic, metallic, van der Waals or hydrogen. However, it is not established whether or not every substance can be put into a glass form. {\textcopyright} 1969, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.},

@article{Cawley2010,
abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds. {\textcopyright} 2010 Gavin C.

abstract = {There is a pressing need to shorten the development period for new materials possessing desired properties. For example, bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) are a unique class of alloy materials utilized in a wide variety of applications due to their attractive physical properties. However, the lack of predictive tools for uncovering the relationships between BMGs' alloy composition and desired properties limits the further application of these materials. In this study, a machine-learning (ML) approach was developed, based on a dataset of 6471 alloys, to enable the construction of a predictive ML model to describe the glass-forming ability and elastic moduli of BMGs. The model's predictions of unseen data were found to be in good agreement with most experimental values. Consequently, we determined that an alloy with a large critical-casting diameter would likely have a high mixing entropy, a high thermal conductivity, and a mixing enthalpy of approximately −28 kJ/mol, and that a BMG with a small average atomic volume would likely have a high elastic modulus. The efficacy of ML was demonstrated in furnishing a mechanistic understanding and enabling the prediction of metallic-glass properties.},
